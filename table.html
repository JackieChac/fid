<td>Izuku Midoriya</td>
<td><i>My Hero Academia</i></td>
<td>16</td>
<td> In a world where most humans on the planet develop superpowers soon after they're born, a boy named Izuku Midoriya was one of the few who never developed any powers. As a child, Izuku dreamed to become a superhero like his idol, All Might, after he developed his power, or "Quirk".</td>
<td>I relate to his character being he is kind and cares for others. He wants to help save people with a smile on his face.</td>
