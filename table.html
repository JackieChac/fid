<td>Izuku Midoriya</td>

<td>16</td>
<td> In a world where most humans on the planet develop superpowers soon after they're born, a boy named Izuku Midoriya was one of the few who never developed any powers. As a child, Izuku dreamed to become a superhero like his idol, All Might, after he developed his power, or "Quirk".</td>

<td>Flutteshy</td>
<td><i>My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</i></td>
<td>20</td>
<td>As a filly, she was even shier than she currently is and was a very clumsy, weak flyer. As such, she was teased by the same bullies who teased Rainbow Dash for her clumsiness (although, despite also being clumsy as a filly, Rainbow Dash was never a weak flyer) with the rhyme "Fluttershy, Fluttershy, Fluttershy can hardly fly. One day, Rainbow Dash challenged them to a race to defend Fluttershy, who was knocked off a cloud and saved by a bunch of butterflies. She was very impressed with the animals and sang a song about it, then when Rainbow Dash broke the sound barrier and caused the "sonic rainboom", the animals were scared away. Fluttershy reassured them and, in the process, discovered she could speak to animals, which was how she got her cutie mark.</td>
<td>She is a kind and shy character and has a love for nature and all sorts of animals. I also consider myself shy at first but then bubbly once you get to know me and I love nature as well as animals</td>
<td>She is also a part of the mane 6 and has the ability to speak to animals.</td>
