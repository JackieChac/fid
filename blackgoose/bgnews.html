<h5>Low and Slow</h5>
 
<p>posted by BGB, November 15, 2016</p>
 
<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous 
vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in 
plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be 
cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as 
<q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve 
a seat at the chef table, contact us before
<time datetime="20161130">November 30</time>.</p>

 <p>Location: Baker’s Corner, Seekonk, MA</p>
 <p>Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to 11pm</p>
